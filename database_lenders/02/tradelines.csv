There is a small origination fee (around $9 – $12) then small monthly payments after that based on how much you want the CD to report as. Each payment is reported to the 3 credit bureaus (don’t screw this up!). At the end of the term, you’ve paid off the loan and you can get the money back + interest – hence saving money while boosting your credit.","We want to leverage this primary tradeline to increase our credit to lower our utilization to boost our credit score.
