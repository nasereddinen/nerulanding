    Once you have established a Bank Rating of Low 5 now itâ€™s essential to maintain that
    balance for a period of 90 days prior to applying for a business loan or line of credit from
    your bank. By achieving a Low 5 Balance Rating the bank will look upon your business as having
    favorable cash flow and a strong ability to repay.
