                <h2>BUSINESS LICENSE</h2>
                <h3>Many business owners ask; “does my business need a license?”
                    Every city, state & country may have different license requirements & filling processes. In addition
                    to this, only certain types of businesses require a license.
                    ​When you file your business entity the state will tell you if a state license is required.
                    Go on your city website or call your city offices to see if your type of business requires a city
                    business license.
                    If your type of business requires a license, file immediately to prevent delays.
                    Make sure you use your correct business information to set up your license. The business information
                    on your license should match the information on all other business records to boost credibility with
                    lenders and others.
                    Renew your business license as required to stay in good standing.</h3>
